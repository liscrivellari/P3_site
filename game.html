    ‘Well, Knipe, my boy. Now that it’s <input type="text" id="Adjectives1" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)">, I
    just called you in
    to tell you I think you’ve done a <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> job.’
    <br>Adolph Knipe stood <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> in front of Mr
    Bohlen’s desk. There seemed to be no enthusiasm in him at all.
    <br>‘Aren’t you <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)">?’ ‘Oh yes, Mr Bohlen.’
    ‘Did you see what the papers said this morning?’ ‘No, sir, I didn’t.’ The man behind the desk pulled a <input
      type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> newspaper towards him, and began to read:
    ‘The building
    of the <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> <input type="text"
      id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> computing engine, ordered by the government some time
    ago, is now <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)">. It is probably the <input
      type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> <input type="text" id="Adjectives"
      name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective"
      placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> machine in the world today. Its function is to satisfy the <input type="text"
      id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> need of science, industry, and administration for <input
      type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)">
    calculation which, in the past, by <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)">
    methods, would have been physically <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)">, or
    would have required more time than the problems justified. The speed with which the <input type="text"
      id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> engine works, said Mr John Bohlen, head of the firm of
    <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> engineers mainly <input type="text"
      id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> for its construction, may be grasped by the fact that it
    can provide the <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> answer in five seconds
    to a problem that would occupy a mathematician for a month. In three minutes,
    it can produce a calculation that by hand (if it were <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective"
      placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)">) would fill half a million sheets of foolscap paper. The <input type="text"
      id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)">
    <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> engine uses pulses of electricity,
    generated at the rate
    of a million a second, to solve all calculations that resolve themselves into addition, subtraction, multiplication,
    and division. For <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> purposes there is no
    limit to what it can do ...’
    <br>Mr Bohlen glanced up at the <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)">, <input
      type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> face of the <input type="text"
      id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> man. ‘Aren’t you <input type="text" id="Adjectives"
      name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)">, Knipe? Aren’t you <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective"
      placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)">?’
    <br>‘Of course, Mr Bohlen.’
    ‘I don’t think I have to remind you that your own contribution, especially to the <input type="text" id="Adjectives"
      name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> plans, was an <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective"
      placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> one. In fact, I might go so far as to say that without you and some of your ideas, this
    project might still be on the drawing-boards today.’
    Adolph Knipe moved his feet on the carpet, and he watched the two
    <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> <input type="text" id="Adjectives"
      name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> hands of his chief, the
    <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> fingers playing with a paperclip,
    unbending it, straightening out the hairpin curves. He didn’t like the man’s hands. He didn’t like his face either,
    with the <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> mouth and the 
    <input type="text" id="Adjectives" name="Adjective" placeholder="adjective" onchange="findOccurrence(value, this)"> lips. It was unpleasant the way only

    the lower lip moved when he talked.
    <br>‘Is anything bothering you, Knipe? Anything on your mind?’ ‘Oh no, Mr Bohlen. No.’ ‘How would you like to take a
    week’s holiday? Do you good. You’ve earned it.’ ‘Oh, I don’t know, sir.’
